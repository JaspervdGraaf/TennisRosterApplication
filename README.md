# TennisRosterApplication
This application is made for the WTC TennisClub in Wezep, the Netherlands. They organize tournaments for children and they wanted to have an handy application to make rosters for these tournaments.

At school we are learning C# so we wanted to make this application in C#, purely for practice.
